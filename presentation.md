## Software Carpentry

Much of this presentation will draw on the [Software
Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) lesson [Version Control with
Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/).

That lesson goes into topics in more detail, with examples and exercises. There
are regular Software Carpentry workshops at the University, open to all
researchers.
